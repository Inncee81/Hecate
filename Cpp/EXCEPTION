GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE EXCEPTION

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This "Exception" is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 ("AGPL"). It applies to parts of the this project bearing a notice placed by the copyright holder stating that these parts are governed by AGPL along with this Additional Term.

Exception Intent

We want specified commercial and/or closed source ("CCS") applications to be able to use specified AGPL-licensed libraries
(the "covered software") despite the fact that not all CSS licenses are compatible with version 3 or later of the GNU Affero 
General Public License (the "AGPL"). This Exception mostly covers game developers and game tool/ engine creators or similar
to be able to publish their work without the need to fully publish their source code to the customers and so ensure that those 
studios can continue making the beautiful games we all like.

0. Definitions

A "covered work" means either the unmodified "Program" or a work based on the "Program", covered by version 3 or any later
version of the GNU Affero General Public License (collectively, "AGPL"), or a work based on such work and licensed under the AGPL.

"Software" means a compiled Program in binary form and any covered work necessary to combine or link the Software with other work, or a work derivative of such a combination based on the Software.

"Schroedinger Entertainment" means the organization account (<https://github.com/SchroedingerEntertainment>) and it's respective copyright holders.

1. Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the AGPL:

In case of forming the Software, you grant permission to Schroedinger Entertainment to copy, modify, propagate, and distribute a work that is formed entirely from the covered work and one or more 
work licensed under the terms and conditions of the AGPL or a work derivative of such a combination, even if such copying, 
modification, propagation, or distribution would otherwise violate the terms of the AGPL. 
Schroedinger Entertainment must still comply with the AGPL in all respects for all of the covered work.

You may include this AGPL Exception and its grant of permissions when you distribute covered work under the
terms and conditions of the AGPL or Software covered by this license Exception.
Inclusion of this notice with such a distribution constitutes a grant of such permission, without affecting any ownership rights or copyright holding to and from Schroedinger Entertainment.

If you do not wish to grant these permissions, remove this Exception from your distribution.
